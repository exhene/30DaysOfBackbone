# 30DaysOfBackboneJS

Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework that helps to structure web applications by providing a set of useful components, such as models, views, collections, and events.

Backbone.js is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides a simplified implementation of it, making it easy to use and understand. The framework allows developers to easily create and manage data models, which can be bound to views to keep the user interface in sync with the data.

Backbone.js also provides a simple event system, which allows developers to easily create custom events and trigger them from different parts of the application. This makes it easy to decouple different parts of the application and create more maintainable code.

Overall, Backbone.js is a great choice for developers who want to create structured, scalable, and maintainable web applications using JavaScript.
